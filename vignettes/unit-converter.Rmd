## Converter

The function `unitConverter()` starts a shiny app in the RStudio Viewer pane that allows users to convert between units of the same dimension as illustrated in the video below.

## Bridging Dimensions with Molecular Weight

So far, the following dimensions can be bridged by __Molecular Weight__:

- __Amount__ and __Mass__
- __Concentration (mass)__ and __Concentration (molar)__
- __AUC (mass)__ and __AUC (molar)__

<!---
TODO: include more units when ospsuite will provide the conversion
- __Amount per time__ and __Mass per time__
- __Amount per area__ and __Mass per area__
- __Amount per area per time__ and __Mass per area per time__
- __Amount per tissue__ and __Mass per tissue__
--->

When selecting one of these dimensions, users are notified by the app that conversion to the bridged dimension is supported.

The __Molecular Weight__ and its __Unit__ defined by the user will be taken into account if converting to the bridged dimension.

## Fractions

For the  __Fraction__ dimension, the unit named `Unitless` is defined as such in the enum `ospUnits` and corresponds to the fraction as is. 

If users need to convert between fractions, they should currently provide the unit `""` instead of `"Unitless"`.
