## Browsing the simulation tree

The function `runSimulationTree()` starts a shiny app in a RStudio dialog window that allows users to browse the simulation tree of a pkml simulation file, and select desired branches/leafs to be copied, as illustrated in the video below.

The shiny app includes a search bar to highlight branches/leafs that include defined keywords. However, using the search bar may slow down the interactivity of the app.

The shiny app is based on the function [`ospsuite::getSimulationTree()`](https://www.open-systems-pharmacology.org/OSPSuite-R/reference/getSimulationTree.html) that returns a tree like structured list allowing for intuitive navigation in the simulation tree.
